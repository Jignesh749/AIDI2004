# Breast Cancer Detection Model

This is a machine learning model built using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on various features.

## Usage

To use this model, simply follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook file. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the code.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing this model can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)). It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Model Versions

- **Version 1:** Built using Logistic Regression algorithm. Located in the master branch.
- **Version 2:** Built using Random Forest algorithm. Located in the newly created branch new_model.
